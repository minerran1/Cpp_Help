Dictionary ADT

Dictionary (map, association list) is a data structure, which is generally an association of unique keys with some values. One may bind a value to a key, delete a key (and naturally an associated value) and lookup for a value by the key. Values are not required to be unique. Simple usage example is an explanatory dictionary. In the example, words are keys and explanations are values.
